		 * The HTTP Client module is bundled as an incubator module in JDK 9 and supports HTTP/2 with backward compatibility still facilitating 
		 * HTTP/1.1. To use it, we need specify the correct module in the module-info.java file to be able to use it. To do so we need to add requires 
		 * "jdk.incubator.httpclient;"
		 * 
		 * Unlike HttpURLConnection, HTTP Client provides synchronous and asynchronous request mechanisms. The API consists of 3 core classes :
		 * - HttpRequest : represents the request to be sent via the HttpClien
		 * - HttpClient : behaves as a container for configuration information common to multiple requests
		 * - HttpResponse : represents the result of an HttpRequest call
		 * 
		 * HttpRequest : it is an object which represents a request we want to send. New instances can be created using HttpRequest.Builder. We can get 
		 * it by calling HttpRequest.newBuilder(). Builder class provides a bunch of methods which we can use to configure our request.
		 */
		
		// The first thing we have to do when creating a request is to provide the URL. We can do that in two ways : by using the constructor for Builder 
		// with URI parameter or by calling method uri(URI) on the Builder instance :
		Builder httpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest.newBuilder(new URI("https://postman-echo.com/get"));
		Builder httpRequestBuilder2 = HttpRequest.newBuilder().uri(new URI("https://postman-echo.com/get"));
		
		// The next thing we have to configure to create a basic request is an HTTP method.
		
		/*
		 * HTTP Method : We can define HTTP method which our request will use by calling one of the methods from Builder :
		 * - GET()
		 * - POST(BodyProcessor body)
		 * - PUT(BodyProcessor body)
		 * - DELETE(BodyProcessor body)
		 */
		
		// Here we will create a simple GET request.
		HttpRequest getRequest = httpRequestBuilder.GET().build();
		
		/*
		 * This request has all parameters required by HttpClient. However, sometimes we need to add additional parameters to our request, for example :
		 * - the version of the HTTP protocol
		 * - headers
		 * - a timeout
		 * 
		 * HTTP Protocol Version : The API fully leverages the HTTP/2 protocol and uses it by default but we can define which version of protocol we want 
		 * to use.

		/*
		 * Setting Headers : In case we want to add additional headers to our request, we can use the provided builder methods. We can do that in one of two

		 * - StringProcessor : reads body from a String, created with HttpRequest.BodyProcessor.fromString
		 * - InputStreamProcessor : reads body from an InputStream, created with HttpRequest.BodyProcessor.fromInputStream
		 * - ByteArrayProcessor : reads body from a byte array, created with HttpRequest.BodyProcessor.fromByteArray
